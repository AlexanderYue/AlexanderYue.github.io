    During the Summer of 2025, I wanted to take bigger steps to expand my career path. I realized that simply just doing college wouldn't be enough, and I would have to do things on my own. I came across a Romanian Youtuber named <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@realcrin" target = 0>Crin</a> who made a video about cheating using python scripts on a Minecraft server. I thought the video was really interesting, and I checked out some of his other videos. I discovered he was actually in the Cybersecurity field, and, being somewhat lost with what I wanted to do in my future, I decided to watch some of his videos concerning the topic. I had always been interested in cybersecurity, especially after hearing about cybercrime online, and Crin was the push I needed to pursue the career.

    He had a video where he laid out a roadmap for people wanting to get into cybersecurity, and one of the first things he mentioned was getting certifications. I had known about certifications, as before Cybersecurity, I wanted to pursue Database Administration, and had looked into getting MongoDB certified. However, I told myself that this would be my first step towards an actual career and securing an actual future for myself.

    I started studying by looking on Crin’s discord server. I discovered there that someone had made a document of every Domain, and the term/definitions in each domain. So I began studying by just reading it, and taking notes in every single term. I went through about 40 pages of notes, and then I started taking mock exams. I quickly noticed that I was struggling most on performance-based problems. In order to remedy this, I asked GPT to create test performance-based problems for me to practice with. I had studied for approximately 23 days, and spent 15 of them reading through the domain notes, and the rest doing as many practice questions as possible. Eventually, I started scoring >85% on practice exams and questions, and I felt like I was ready to take the exam. 

    Closing out my thoughts on the exam, the MCQ was definitely easier than I expected, especially because I was focusing a lot on memorization for the exam. However, the hardest part that I needed to study more was performance based questions. They are different because you can't just memorize topics, you have to understand a multiple wide array of topics, like VPN’s, log reading, and networking topics.
