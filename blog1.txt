    During the summer of 2025, I decided to take a big step toward my future career. I had the feeling that college alone wasn't going to be enough, and I needed to take the initiative on my own. Around that time, I stumbled upon a Romanian YouTuber named <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@realcrin" target = 0>Crin</a> , who posted a video about using Python scripts to cheat on a Minecraft server. The video immediately grabbed my attention, and as I explored more of his content, I discovered he actually worked in cybersecurity.

    At the time, I felt pretty lost about my career path, but I had always been curious about cybersecurity after reading stories about cybercrime. Crin's content gave me the push I needed to seriously pursue this field. One of his videos laid out a clear roadmap for beginners, and a key first step he emphasized was getting certified. I had looked into certifications before when I considered database administration, like the MongoDB certification, but this time felt different. This was my chance to build a real career and secure my future.

    I started by joining Crin's Discord community, where I found a detailed document with terms and definitions for every Security+ domain. I used this as my foundation, studying and taking notes on every single term. By the time I was done, I had nearly 40 pages of handwritten notes. After that, I moved on to practice exams and quickly realized my biggest weakness was the performance-based questions.

    To improve, I asked an AI to generate custom performance-based problems for me, which helped me strengthen my understanding of concepts like VPNs, log analysis, and networking. My study schedule lasted about 23 days—15 days for reading the domain notes, and the rest for practice questions and mock exams. Over time, I consistently scored above 85% on practice tests, which gave me the confidence to schedule the real exam.

    Looking back, the multiple-choice part of the exam was easier than I expected, probably because of all the memorization I had done. However, the performance-based questions were the real challenge. Unlike multiple-choice, they required a genuine understanding and application of knowledge across a wide range of topics. That experience taught me that cybersecurity isn't just about memorizing facts—it's about problem-solving and connecting the dots between different areas of knowledge.
