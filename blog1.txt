    During the summer of 2025, I decided it was time to take bigger steps toward my future career. I realized that just going to college wasn’t enough—I needed to take initiative on my own. Around that time, I came across a Romanian YouTuber named <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@realcrin" target = 0>Crin</a> who posted a video about using Python scripts to cheat on a Minecraft server. The video caught my attention, and as I explored more of his content, I discovered that he actually worked in the cybersecurity field.

    At the time, I was feeling somewhat lost about my career direction, but I had always been curious about cybersecurity—especially after reading stories about cybercrime online. Crin’s content gave me the push I needed to seriously pursue this path.

    One of his videos laid out a clear roadmap for beginners entering cybersecurity, and one of the first steps he emphasized was obtaining certifications. I already knew a bit about certifications from when I considered database administration, even looking into MongoDB certification. But this time felt different—this was my chance to start building a real career and secure my future.

    I began by joining Crin’s Discord community, where I found a detailed document covering every Security+ domain with terms and definitions. I used this as my foundation, studying and taking notes on every single term. By the time I finished, I had nearly 40 pages of handwritten notes. After that, I shifted to practice exams, where I quickly realized that my weakest area was performance-based questions.

    To improve, I asked GPT to generate custom performance-based practice problems for me, which helped me strengthen my understanding of concepts like VPNs, log analysis, and networking. My study schedule lasted about 23 days—15 of them spent reading domain notes, and the rest focused on practice questions and mock exams. Over time, I consistently scored above 85% on practice tests, which gave me the confidence to schedule the real exam.

    Looking back, the multiple-choice portion of the exam was easier than I expected, largely because of the heavy memorization I had done. However, the performance-based questions were the real challenge. Unlike multiple-choice, they required true understanding and application of knowledge across a wide range of topics. That experience taught me that cybersecurity isn’t about memorization—it’s about problem-solving and connecting the dots between different areas of knowledge.
